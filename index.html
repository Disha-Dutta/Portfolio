<p style="font-family: "Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif; padding:250px;" > I am a ambitious, self-made, work alcoholic but down to earth person. I like to balance professional and family life. Professional life gives you exposure, confidence and sense of achievement. I believe the fulfillment one gets from one’s work is very important for wellbeing. I also participate in family get-togethers, functions, parties, etc. My favourite pastime is to watch  movies, dancing, cooking and <b>sleeping</b> :) .</p></div>
